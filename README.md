> The models contained are trained based on a train dataset of 80k 200x200 images. For now, it supports predicting gemstone shape, color and identification. Before clone the code and start using, you need to download the pretrained models from [models.7z](https://drive.google.com/file/d/107H4-UwBasKETEnN0woE76NMZ27dqzCf/view?usp=sharing).

[AutoGem](https://github.com/Samueli924/AutoGem) is based on the latest Convolutional Neural Network. The train dataset sample and detailed training model will be made public soon. Please ‚≠ê **star this repo to follow up**.

## üìö Getting Started quickly

1. **Install requirements**:  
   Begin by `pip/pip3 install -r requirements`

3. **Set up Tensorflow GPU(Optional)**  
   Follow the [Official Documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/gpu?hl=zh-cn) to configure GPU Support

4. **Start FLASK App**  
  Start the app by `python3 app.py`
  
5. **Use the AutoGemUI**  
   Use browser [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

6. **Upload Colored Gemstone Image**  
    **The gemstone must be in the .shape file within the downloaded models.7z file**. The image uploaded should be 1:1 ratio, best to be 200x200 pixels.
